# Microsoft FastTrack Open Source - Delete-YammerGroups

This sample script will allow a Yammer admin to bulk-delete groups/communities

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- You must register an app and generate a bearer token (aka Developer Token) in your Yammer network for use with this script, you’ll need itfor the next step below. Detailed instructions on how to generate this can be found here: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-developer/generating-an-administrator-token/m-p/97058

- You'll need to create a CSV file containing one column:
	- **GroupID**. This will contain the IDs of the groups you want to delete.
 
  The CSV should look similar to this:

  ![CSV format](bulkdeleteCSV.jpg?raw=true "Title")

  You can get the group ID of the groups you need to add the admins to in one of three ways:

    1. Grab the group ID from the group's URL and use a BASE64 decoder on the string at the end as described here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-do-i-find-a-community-s-group-feed-id-in-yammer-9372ab6f-          bcc2-4283-bb6a-abf42dec970f
    2. Run a network data export going back as far as possible (do not export attachments) and get the group ID from the groups.csv file generated: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/yammer/network-data-export
    3. If you're doing this pre-native mode migration, you can get the group IDs from the alignment report you're basing your cleanup on.

### Variables

There are 3 variables you need to change in the script itself. These are located very early in the script just below “<############    STUFF YOU NEED TO MODIFY    ############>”:

1. **$Global:YammerAuthToken = "BearerTokenString"**

	  Replace BearerTokenString with the token you created via the instructions in the prerequisites. The line should look something like this:

    $Global:YammerAuthToken = "21737620380-GFy6awIxfYGULlgZvf43A"

2. **$groupsToBeDeletedCSV = 'C:\temp\groupstobedeleted.csv'**
  
    Point this to the groupstobedeleted.csv file you created as mentioned above.

3. **$whatIfMode = $true**

   The script runs in a WhatIf mode by default since the group deletion can’t be undone, so it’ll only loop through the CSV and tell you which groups it *would* have deleted, it doesn’t actually take hard action. When        you’re ready to have it actually delete groups, change the value to $false
  
### Parameters

None

### Execution

Once you’ve completed the pre-reqs, you’re ready to go. Run the script like so:

	.\Delete-YammerGroups.ps1

### Notes

**This sample calls an undocumented endpoint in the Yammer REST APIs, and as such has no official support provided for it, and may stop working without warning.**
