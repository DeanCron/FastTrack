# Microsoft FastTrack Open Source - Yammer-NetworkDataExport

This sample script calls the Yammer Network Data Export API to export messages and (optionally) files from your Yammer network for the date range specified in the command. 

## Usage

### Prerequisites

You must register an app and  generate a bearer token (aka Developer Token) in your Yammer network for use with this script, you’ll need itfor the next step below. Detailed instructions on how to generate this can be found here: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-developer/generating-an-administrator-token/m-p/97058

There are only 2 variables you need to change in the script itself. These are located very early in the script just below “<############    STUFF YOU NEED TO MODIFY    ############>”:

1. $Global:YammerAuthToken = "BearerTokenString"

	Replace BearerTokenString with the token you created via the instructions in the prerequisites. The line should look something like this:

	$Global:YammerAuthToken = "21737620380-GFy6awIxfYGULlgZvf43A"

2. $rootPath = "C:\Temp"

	Replace the path above with the path you’d like the export data saved to. The script will create separate folders under this root path for each start/end date combination you run it with to try and keep the data 				separate.
  
### Parameters

##StartDate <YYYY-MM-DD>##
    REQUIRED. Sets the start date for the target date range of the export
##EndDate <YYYY-MM-DD>##
    OPTIONAL. Sets the end date for the target date range of the export. We recommend including this and setting a reasonable range to avoid timeouts.
##IncludeFiles <all/csv>##
    OPTIONAL. Set this to ‘all’ for CSVs (including messages) and all file attachments, or ‘csv’ for CSVs only (including messages), no file attachments.
##IncludeFiles <true/false>##
    OPTIONAL. Setting this to ‘true’ would result in CSVs and/or file attachments downloaded for the primary network and all associated external networks.
    This is unnecessary for native mode migration, as migration doesn’t touch external networks 
  
### Execution
  
Once you’ve made and saved those changes, you’re ready to go. To run the script, pass the start date for the export and any of the three optional parameters shown above. For example, if I wanted to export all data from the main network only (not any of the associated external networks), I'd run the script like so:

	.\Yammer-NetworkDataExport.ps1 -startdate 2023-01-14 -enddate 2023-01-31 -IncludeFiles All

Reminder - The StartDate and EndDate parameters need to be in the YYYY-MM-DD format as shown above. Once complete, the console output will tell you where to find the result, which should be a date-named folder underneath your $rootPath set above.

### Notes

Even though you can download files/attachments using this API, we recommend only using this script to download messages if you need a large timeframe and/or have a large number of files in the network. This API starts the download as soon as you execute it, downloading each file one by one, and if there are a lot of files it can result in failure. Generally we recommend using the Files Export API for file downloads, as that packages up all files into one or more zip files on the back-end, and then it downloads the resulting zip(s). This tends to be more reliable. See my Yammer-FilesExport script in this repository to download files from your network.
  
Console output is minimal. This is more of a ‘fire and go get a cup of coffee’ type thing based on how the API works, so detailed logging is sent to a logfile that will be created in the same folder the export data is saved to. If there are errors during script execution relating to issues making calls to the API, detailed info will be logged to that script log, along with various pieces of key information along the way. The console output will only give basic info on what step it’s on, and in the event of API call failure, just let you know it failed and point you to that log for more information.

Each time you run this, it will create a new folder under the $rootPath you specify that will be named for the export timeframe you specified. In that folder you'll find one or more files for the file downloads, along with the detailed script log showing each execution step. The console output from each script run will point you to the specific folder for that run.

If your network is in native mode, no files will be downloaded. Included among the CSV files that do get downloaded, you'll see files.csv, which contains information on each file in the network, including the SPO/OneDrive of each. Actual files are only exported from pre-native mode networks where the files are still in Yammer's file store, not ones that exist in SharePoint.
