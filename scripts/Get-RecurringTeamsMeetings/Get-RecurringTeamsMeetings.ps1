.SYNOPSIS
    Reports on all recurring Teams meetings using a secure App Registration connection.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script connects to Microsoft Graph using Application permissions to find all recurring
    Teams meetings. It prompts for connection details securely. It fetches all calendar events
    for each user, filters them locally, and correctly handles complex attendee lists (e.g.,
    distribution lists, groups) to prevent errors in the final report. The report
    is saved in the same directory as the script.
