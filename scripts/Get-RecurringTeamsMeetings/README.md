# üìú Microsoft Teams Recurring Meeting Report

This PowerShell script scans all user calendars in a Microsoft 365 tenant to find and report on all recurring Teams meetings. It exports key details to a CSV file, including the organizer, meeting subject, participant count, and a list of invited participants.

The script uses the Microsoft Graph API with **Application permissions**, ensuring it can run securely as an authorized background process.

## ‚öôÔ∏è One-Time Setup: Create an App Registration

2.  Go to **Identity** \> **Applications** \> **App registrations**.
3.  Click **+ New registration**.
4.  Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `Teams Meeting Report Script`).
5.  Leave the other settings as default and click **Register**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Grant API Permissions

1.  In your new App Registration, go to the **API permissions** blade.
2.  Click **+ Add a permission**, then select **Microsoft Graph**.
3.  Select **Application permissions**.
4.  Search for and check the boxes next to the following two permissions:
      * `Calendars.Read`
      * `User.Read.All`
5.  Click **Add permissions**.
6.  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Click the **Grant admin consent for [Your Tenant]** button to approve the permissions. The status for both should change to a green checkmark.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Client Secret

1.  Go to the **Certificates & secrets** blade.
2.  Click **+ New client secret**.
3.  Add a description and choose an expiration period.
4.  Click **Add**.
5.  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Immediately copy the secret's "Value"** and save it somewhere secure (like a password manager). You will not be able to see it again after you leave this page.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Script

1.  Save the script to your computer with a `.ps1` extension (e.g., `Get-RecurringTeamsMeetings.ps1`).
2.  Open a PowerShell terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
3.  Run the script:
    ```powershell
    .\Get-RecurringTeamsMeetings.ps1
    ```
4.  You will be prompted to enter the following information:
      * **Directory (Tenant) ID**: Found on the **Overview** page of your App Registration.
      * **Application (Client) ID**: Also found on the **Overview** page of your App Registration.
      * **Client Secret**: The secret value you copied. Your input will be hidden for security.
