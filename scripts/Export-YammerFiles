# Microsoft FastTrack Open Source - Export-YammerFiles

This sample script calls the Yammer Files Export API to export files from your Yammer network that were uploaded by users during the date range specified in the command. 

## Usage

### Prerequisites

You must register an app and  generate a bearer token (aka Developer Token) in your Yammer network for use with this script, you’ll need itfor the next step below. Detailed instructions on how to generate this can be found here: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-developer/generating-an-administrator-token/m-p/97058

There are only 2 variables you need to change in the script itself. These are located very early in the script just below “<############    STUFF YOU NEED TO MODIFY    ############>”:

1. $Global:YammerAuthToken = "BearerTokenString"

	Replace BearerTokenString with the token you created via the instructions in the prerequisites. The line should look something like this:

	$Global:YammerAuthToken = "21737620380-GFy6awIxfYGULlgZvf43A"

2. $rootPath = "C:\Temp"

	Replace the path above with the path you’d like the export data saved to. The script will create separate folders under this root path for each start/end date combination you run it with to try and keep the data 				separate.

### Parameters

**StartDate YYYY-MM-DD**
	
	REQUIRED. Sets the start date for the target date range of the export
**EndDate YYYY-MM-DD**
	
	REQUIRED. Sets the end date for the target date range of the export. 
	NOTE: If the script fails while waiting on file packaging, we reocmmend shortening the start/end date windows.

### Execution

Once you’ve made and saved those changes, you’re ready to go. To run the script, just pass the startdate and enddate for the time period you want exported files from, like so:

	.\Export-YammerFiles.ps1 -startdate 2023-01-14 -enddate 2023-01-31

Reminder - Those parameters need to be in the YYYY-MM-DD format as shown above. Once complete, the console output will tell you where to find the result, which should be a date-named folder underneath your $rootPath set above.

### Notes

Console output is minimal. This is more of a ‘fire and go get a cup of coffee’ type thing based on how the API works, so detailed logging is sent to a logfile that will be created in the same folder the export data is saved to. If there are errors during script execution relating to issues making calls to the API, detailed info will be logged to that script log, along with various pieces of key information along the way. The console output will only give basic info on what step it’s on, and in the event of API call failure, just let you know it failed and point you to that log for more information.

Each time you run this, it will create a new folder under the $rootPath you specify that will be named for the export timeframe you specified. In that folder you'll find one or more zip files for the file downloads, along with the detailed script log showing each execution step. The console output from each script run will point you to the specific folder for that run.

If your network is in native mode, no files will be downloaded. You'll get a CSV file with information on each file in the network that includes the URL of each. Actual files are only exported from pre-native mode networks where the files are still in Yammer's file store, not SharePoint.

## Applies To
