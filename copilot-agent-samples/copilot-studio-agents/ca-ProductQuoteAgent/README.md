# üßæ Product Quote Agent 

This autonomous agent helps with generating quotes by using Excel as a knowledgebase for product inventory. It leverages Power Automate to populate a Word template with quote details and emails the final document based on the user's request.

**Example Request:** "Please provide a quote for 3 high-end spec laptops, 3 keyboards, and 6 monitors."

3.  **Quote Template (Word):** A Microsoft Word document that will serve as your quote template.

### üöÄ Setup and Import Guide

Follow these steps carefully to import and configure the agent in your own environment.

#### **Step 1: Download the Solution**

Download the solution file located in this directory:
* `./Solution/ProductQuoteAgent.zip`

#### **Step 2: Import the Solution into Power Apps**

1.  Navigate to [**Power Apps**](https://make.powerapps.com/).
2.  Select the correct **Environment** from the top-right corner where you want to install the agent.
3.  On the left navigation pane, select **Solutions**.
4.  Click **Import solution** from the top menu.
5.  Click **Browse**, locate the `ProductQuoteAgent.zip` file you downloaded, and click **Next**.
6.  The wizard will prompt you to configure connections. Establish the necessary connections for **Dataverse**, **Office 365 Outlook**, **SharePoint**, etc., by selecting them or creating new ones. Click **Next** once all connections are ready.
7.  You will be asked to configure **Environment Variables**. This is where you link the solution to your resources.
    * **Email Address:** Enter the email address you want the quotes to be sent from.
8.  Click **Import** and wait for the process to complete. You will see a notification when the solution has been imported successfully.

#### **Step 3: Configure the Power Automate Flow**

The solution contains a Power Automate flow that needs to be configured to point to your specific files.

1.  Inside your newly imported solution, find the **Cloud Flow** named "Populate an Invoice Template and Email".
2.  Open the flow in **edit** mode.
3.  Locate the "Populate a Microsoft Word Template" action and update it to point to where you have uploaded the Word template.
4.  **Save** the flow.
5.  Go back to the flow's details page and make sure it is **Turned On**.

#### **Step 4: Test Your Agent**

1.  Navigate to **Microsoft Copilot Studio**.
2.  Open your **Product Quote Agent**.
3.  Use the test pane to interact with your agent. Try a request like the example at the top of this guide.

Your agent should now be fully configured and ready to generate quotes!
