# Multi-Agent Manager Simulator

## Overview
The multi-agent manager simulator is meant to help aspiring and experienced managers practice their manager communications by drafting a scenario with the help of the *Scenario agent*, engaging in role play with the *Employee Agent* and ultimately receiving coaching advice from the *Coaching Agent*. 

How to Use:
1. Start in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat. 
2. @mention the *Scenario Agent* and prompt it "load scenario". 
3. Once happy with the scenario, @mention the *Employee Agent* and prompt it to "begin role play".
4. Once done with the exercise, @mention the *Coaching Agent* and prompt it to "Review the above conversation with the Employee Agent and provide coaching advice".
