# 🚀 FastTrack for Copilot Agents 🚀

Welcome to the official FastTrack repository for agent templates! 👋 This is your one-stop-shop for getting a head start on building powerful and intelligent agents for both **Microsoft Copilot Studio** and **Agent Builder**.

Whether you're a seasoned pro or just getting started, these templates are designed to accelerate your development process and showcase what's possible.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main directories, one for each platform:

* `copilot-studio-agents/`
    * Contains agent templates, examples, and solutions specifically designed for **Microsoft Copilot Studio**. These are great for building sophisticated, enterprise-grade agents. Our sample **custom agents** are prefixed with `ca-` . 

* `agent-builder-agents/`
    * Contains agent templates tailored for the **Agent Builder** in Copilot. These are perfect for creating more focused, task-oriented agents quickly. Note these can also be easily repurposed to be used with SharePoint Agents. Our sample **declarative agents** are prefixed with `da-` .
