# Sample Declarative and Custom Agents

Welcome to our collection of sample declarative agents and custom agents! This repository provides ready-to-use agent examples for both customers and the open source community. These samples demonstrate a range of capabilities and use cases that you can build upon for your own projects.

## What are Declarative Agents?

Declarative agents are AI agents defined through configuration rather than code. They allow you to quickly create, customize, and deploy specialized AI assistants without extensive programming. Our sample declarative agents are prefixed with `da-` and showcase different interaction patterns and capabilities. 

Our sample custom agents are prefixed with `ca-` .
