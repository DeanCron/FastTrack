Welcome to the home for Microsoft FastTrack Open Source Software (FTOSS). Through this initiative we are collecting tools, scripts, and guidance from across the FastTrack program, our partners, and anyone who wants to contribute with the aim to make them easier to find, grow, and improve. Please let us know any questions or feedback you have using the [issues list](https://github.com/Microsoft/FastTrack/issues).

## Scripts

We have a collection of [scripts](scripts) to help with deploying Microsoft 365. Each script folder has a readme describing what the script does and how to use it. If you have scripts you would like to add please submit a Pull Request.
